# File Browser

A component for rending out a browsable file system structure.

## Directory interface

The file system rendered out by the FileBrowser component is modelled by the Directory type, which is defined as so:

```typescript
declare interface Directory {
  [index: string]: string | Directory;
}
```

When the value associated with a key is a string, that key is a file, and the value is it's contents.

Providing FileBrowser a Directory object as the `data` prop will render it out and allow you to browse it.

## Composition

FileBrowser is composed of three components:

- [Browser](?path=/docs/components-file-browser-browser--basic), which is a wrapper around the other two components and provides the driving logic for navigation.
- [FileDisplay](?path=/docs/components-file-browser-file-display--plain-text), which renders out an individual file for viewing, with syntax highlighting.
- [FileList](?path=/docs/components-file-browser-file-list--basic), which renders out a list of files and exposes a callback for each (to facilitate navigation).

It also makes use of the [useQueryParam hook](?path=/docs/hooks-usequeryparam--example)
