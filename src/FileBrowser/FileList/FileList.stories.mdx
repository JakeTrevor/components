# File List

Given a Directory object, this component renders out the top level of Keys.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Basic"
    args={{
      data: basicExampleDir,
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="Basic" />

FileList takes two props:

- data - which must be a [Directory object](http://localhost:6006/?path=/docs/components-file-browser-outline--page#Directory%20interface)
- update - which will discuss in detail [below](#onClick)

## Icons

FileList will analyse the contents of each key to determine if it is a file (value is a string) or a directory (value is an object). It then assigns an icon to each item, as below:

<IconGallery>
  <IconItem name="Folder">
    <Folder />
  </IconItem>
  <IconItem name="File">
    <File />
  </IconItem>
</IconGallery>

These can be swapped out as needed.

## onClick <a name="onClick"/>

FileList also exposes an "update" function, which is used for changing directory.

Whenever one of the items it is displaying is clicked on, it calls the update function which was passed in as a prop. It must have the type:

```typescript
(newDir: string) => void
```

The `newDir` argument will be the key (or "name") of the item clicked on. So for example here, if you click on "helloWorld.py" below, that is what will be passed to update.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Python"
    args={{
      data: pythonExampleDir,
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

You can check this in actions.
