# Canvas

This component produces the actual Canvas element in the DOM. It exposes to its children a context, which has the required refs and details to allow them to draw to the canvas.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Basic"
    args={{ style: { "box-shadow": "0 3px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.384)" } }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="Basic" />

Props on the Canvas pass through directly to the HTML element (unless otherwise specified), so you can interact with it just as you usually would.
